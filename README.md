# Description
    - This project was created in order to create logos easily as a .svg file so that it could be resized without having a pixel problem.
    - The project was built in order to review and learn about the use of objeects and classes.
    - Testing of these shapes could be learned while using jest. This showed me if the coding was done properly.
    - I was able to use inquire and jest in order to bring the information in, create the logo and then test the coding in order to make sure it was reading the classes properly.  

## Installation  
    You will need to download the repository, then in the terminal run npm intall in order to have the node modules, inquire, and jest install.

## Usage  
    In order to run this program go to the terminal and enter node index.js. Run thru the series of questions to choose the shape, color, text and text color. When it is done it will generate a file named logo.svg. This can be viewed in your browser or with Live Preview in Visual Studio Code.
